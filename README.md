Ascension
=========

Ascension Source Code -- A Skyrim inspired, RGP adventure.

Ascension is a new mod idea for Minecraft which aims to create an immersive, 
challenging adventure for you to explore. Inspired a lot by Skyrim, you'll jump into 
your own world, battling intimidation monsters, slaying mysterious bosses, looting 
seemingly innocent ruins, ultimately leading you up to recapturing the lost Artifacts 
of the Founders.
