Upload .schematic files here to this folder.

These files should be ready to convert to Java. So they need the following:
1) If the structure is to have a chest(s) with random loot, include the chest(s).
2) If the sturcture has only one chest, but the location is picked at random out of several possible locations, put a chest in each of those locations.
3) The schematic should include the floor, but not any of the surrounding landscape.
4) Include a text file with the same name as the .scematic file, but with .txt extention, that has this information:
  a) Short description
  b) If not original, the authors name and text of the permission to use file (could be something generic from forum)
  c) Location of the entrance relative to the 0,0 coordinates
  d) The number of chests that should be randomly created.

I will add an example .schematic named example.schematic with an example.txt to show how this works.
